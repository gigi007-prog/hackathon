# Gigi and Eli
1. Your hackathon project is great! The code is clean, and readable. The idea is well-thought-out, and the execution and results are good.
2. From your code and your comments, I can tell that you understand what you've done and how you've done it.
3. I liked that you weren't afraid to use modules and Python functionalities that we didn't learn in class. That shows initiative and is a great quality for a developer!
4. However here are few issues that I noticed in your code:
    1. You might want to delete or add to .gitignore the files you don’t really need once the project is done, or files you don’t want to push to GitHub.
    2. The content of the file mood_tracker.py is already in stressass.py
    3. Try to structure your code better. Don’t be afraid to create separate files and split your functions across them to make the project more organized and cleaner.
